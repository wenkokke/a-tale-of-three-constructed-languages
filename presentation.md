## Lingua Ignota *per simplicem hominem Hildegardem prolata*
### by Hildegaard von Bingen

---

# Lingua Ignota

- *Created by* St. Hildegaard von Bingen *ca.* 1200
- *Script called* Litteræ Ignotæ
- *Glossary of* 1011 nouns *and adjectives*
- *Substitute words into* Latin phrases
- *Meant as a* secret language *(citation needed)*
- *Meant to* clearly and unambiguously express herself

^
Hildegaard was a German abbess in Rupertsberg ca. 1200.

^
An obvious choice for patron saint of conlangers.

^
This is a trend we see in a lot of constructed languages:
- Script maps 1-to-1 to Latin alphabet
- List a bunch of words, mostly nouns
- Grammar of a language you know

^
Evidence in her letters indicates others knew of her language.

[.quote: LitteraeIgnotae]

> O orzchis Ecclesia, armis divinis praecincta, et hyacinto ornata, tu es caldemia stigmatum loifolum et urbs scienciarum. O, o tu es etiam crizanta in alto sono, et es chorzta gemma.

^
First thought: I have to make a font for this. Fortunately, someone had already done that for me!

^
Anyway: this is what it looks like.

^
Wikipedia cites this as "the only extant text in the language".

---

> *O* orzchis *Ecclesia, armis divinis praecincta, et hyacinto ornata, tu es* caldemia *stigmatum* loifolum *et urbs scienciarum. O, o tu es etiam* crizanta *in alto sono, et es* chorzta *gemma.*

^
When you transliterate that, this is what you get.

^
Curiously, in the entire passage, there's only five Lingua Ignota words.

| Lingua Ignota                  | English
| ---                            | ---
| *O* orzchis *Ecclesia*         | *O* measureless *Church*
| *tu es* caldemia *stigmatum*   | *you are the* fragrance
| loifulum *et urbs scienciarum* | *of the wounds of* nations
| *O, o tu es etiam* crizanta    | *O, o, and you are* anointed
| *es* chorzta *gemma*           | *you are a* sparkling *gem*

^
This all seems VERY religious.

^
The glossary is not in any alphabetical order, but in order of hierarchy; of course, God and angels listed are first.

^
An obsession with hierarchy is a common trend in early conlangs!

^
We could easily find ourselves saying that this language had a religious purpose for Hildegaard, but don't forget that she's an 11th century abbess. A lot of things in her life were probably very religious!

# Láadan
### *by Suzette Haden Elgin*

# Láadan

- *Created by* Suzette Haden Elign *ca.* 1985
- *Rules for* phonology*,* morphology*,* grammar*, etc.*
- *Glossary of* 1000 words *with ways to* create new words
- *Offered within a* work of fiction*: Native Tongue*
- *Meant to* test a socio-linguistic hypothesis
- *Within the framework of the* Sapir-Whorf *hypothesis*

^
Suzette had a Ph.D. in Linguistics, writing two dissertations:
one on English, one on Navajo.

^
Here's something infuriating:
Suzette started writing Science Fiction to pay her tuition.

---

> *Hypothesis*
> Existing human languages are inadequate to express the perceptions of women

---

# A Thought Experiment

1. *the* Sapir-Whorf *hypothesis is true*
2. *existing languages are* inadequate for women
3. *change in* language brings societal change
4. *when offered a women's language:*
   - *women will* adopt it *or;*
   - *women will* create a better language

---

# Problems with English

- words obscure imperfection
  *their meaning does not conform to the reality perceived by women*

- words are insufficiently nuanced
  *their meaning glosses over a vast range of distinct female experiences*

- *there is* too much potential for misunderstanding

| *lowitheláad* | to feel another's feelings as if directly
| *radíidin*    | non-holiday, holiday more work that it’s worth*, a time allegedly a holiday but actually so much a burden because of work and preparations that it is a dreaded occasion; especially when there are too many guests and none of them help*
| *rathoo*      | non-guest*, someone who comes to visit knowing perfectly well that* they are intruding and causing difficulty
| *doroledim*   | overeating followed by guilt *(when food is the only part of your life you have control over)*

^
The final definition comes with a text, which does not fit on a slide, situating the act, by describing how the only thing in the average woman's life which she has control over is food.

^
Terms are often defined negatively, in terms of they are not, in an attempt to amend the way English does not match the way reality is perceived by Elgin and the women she interviewed.

## A Brief Feminist Analysis of Láadan

- based on the experiences of Suzette
  *and the women whom she consulted*
  
- copies over societal taboos
  *e.g. has no more nuanced words for sex*

- assumes traditional model of sex and gender:
  - *assumes* sex is binary
  - *assumes* gender is binary, immutable, determined by sex
  
<!-- Láadan --!>

One of the conspicuous things about the terms featured in the lexicon is that many of them are negative terms, as indicated by the prefix “ra.” It is striking that while Utopian societies are often structured along negative lines, their perfection being defined by the absence of certain ills and deficiencies present in reality, Láadan seems to contain many words which are attempts to improve language by revealing what things are not, . “Holiday” thus means one thing in standard English and in the mouths of speakers but has quite the opposite sense in the experience of these women, and a similar problem is observed in the case of the word “guest”. Láadan can clearly be seen as an attempt to reduce the deceptive nature of language observed in English, and it functions in a rather paradoxical way by coining words to describe what things are not, to refer to all the things that are not what they are said to be, or that do not correspond to the definition of the term used to describe them.

Láadan also reflects Elgin’s desire to eliminate discord and misunderstanding in human communication by introducing what she terms Speech Act words. These are obligatory and always occupy the first position in any Láadan sentence.

The Speech Act words bear witness to Elgin’s attempt to make speech clearer and more explicit, by creating a language in which the speaker must not only state whether he/she is stating or asking, etc., but also define the type of statement according to the perceived context in which it is formulated and meant to be received. Meaning and form, it is suggested, are thus connected more tightly in Láadan than in English, reducing, one can only surmise, the potentially deceptive nature of the language. The extremely cumbersome nature of this particular linguistic device appears to have escaped its creator.

One final detail also needs to be mentioned: Láadan possesses evidentials, to reveal why the speaker feels justified in claiming that the words spoken are true.

Evidentials are placed at the end of sentences and, like Speech Act Words, are obligatory. How one is actually supposed to recall, in conversation, the source of one’s information, is not explained by the author.
